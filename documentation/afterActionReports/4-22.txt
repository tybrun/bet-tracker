After Action Report
Tyler Brunelle

Accomplishments
    Programming
        Continued writing code
            Struggling to get familiar with tkinter
                There is probably a much better way to go about this
                Tkinter was likely not the best decision, too late to switch up now
    SQL
        Have to drop this, don't even have a good link with an Excel file right now
        Will just work out of an Excel file
        Too late to design any other good method of storing data
    Documentation
        Failing, spending too much time trying to create a working product
    Product Management
        Failing, failed to plan ahead, make time to work on project
    

Notes
    I need to get a lot better managing time, planning effectively
