After Action Report
Tyler Brunelle

Accomplishments
    Programming
        Things finally clicked today, but way too little way too late
        Poor and disappointing product
        Was hoping for a lot more
        Ok attempt at my first GUI
        Lots of room to grow
    Documentation
        Struggled, trying to catch up in the last week is bad
    Product Management
        Bad, not good
    

Notes
    Really should have carved out time during the semester, mental note for future assignments
