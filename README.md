# Tyler Brunelle: EECE3093 Semester Project

**This project will be a sports bet tracker.**
Programmed in Python, data stored in an SQL database.

## Intent
Develop a program to log sports bets across sportsbooks, providing bettors full insights on their record, habits, etc.

## Structure
In early stages of development, data will be stored in a .csv file.
As development progresses, will convert that to an SQL database.
Program will be coded in Python, utilizing Pandas for data analysis.

## Reasoning
Many of my friends sports bet, but I am too worried about potential losses to play at all.
With this program, I can use a more methodical apporach, instead of throwing money around like crazy.
I want to utilize SQL as I have been taking courses on it over the last two semesters.
I want to bridge the gap between those courses and my usual CS courses.
I am using Python as I am familiar with it, and Pandas because it is great for data analysis.

## Project Goals
A working product that I can use for personel use.
If I enjoy it, this project could be continued to develop it on a bigger scale.
